## Dependencies

This project is using [Ganja.js](https://github.com/enkimute/ganja.js) for geometric algebra calculation.
Color transformation made using the [rgb2hsl function](https://gist.github.com/mjackson/5311256). Perlin noise was based on this [function](https://www.michaelbromley.co.uk/blog/simple-1d-noise-in-javascript/).
